1) classes: Classes are like blueprints for creating objects.you define what the object has and what it can do.they make your code clean and organized
2)Arrow function:Arrow function is ashort, snappy way to write functions.theyre super clean for stuff like looping through lists
3)variables:let and const are your go to for variables, a variable is a store that keeps data which is subseptable to change
4)Array Methods: they are very handy when it comes to arrays and each method has its own unique attribute its unique attributes are explained in the code
5)Destructing: It is like unpacking a gift box= you grab exactly what you want from an object or array in one line, this makes it quick and clean
6. Modules
Modules let you split your code into separate files, like organizing your notes into different folders. You write a function or variable in one file, share it with export, and bring it into another with import. It keeps your project tidy and lets you reuse code without cluttering everything up.
7. Ternary Operators
Ternary operators are a quick way to say, “If this, do that, otherwise do something else.” Like, “Is it sunny? Wear shades, else grab a jacket.” They’re great for simple choices, like showing a “Log In” or “Log Out” button
8. Spread Operators
The spread operator (...) is like spilling out a bag of goodies. You can copy arrays or objects, mix them together, or pass a bunch of items to a function. It’s perfect for things like combining two lists or making a copy of data so you don’t accidentally change the original.
